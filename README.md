## Project Objective

The Birth Rate Analysis project involves the analysis of birth rate data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) with the aim of identifying key factors influencing birth rates and developing predictive models for forecasting future birth rates.
## Problem Statement

 The primary problem addressed in this project is to analyze birth rate data.
## Introduction
